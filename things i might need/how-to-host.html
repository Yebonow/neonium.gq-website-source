HOW TO SETUP A SERVER
<BR>
<font color="red">
  PLEASE CONFIGURE THE HOST.LUA THING (you can find it by going to the client folder, going to the content folder and going to the scripts folder and double clicking host.lua) BEFORE DOING THE REST.
  </font>
<br>
OPEN THE CLIENT. OPEN A MAP FROM THE <code>stuff</code> FOLDER.
<BR>
GO TO THE COMMAND BAR AND TYPE dofile('rbxasset://scripts/host.lua')
<br>
And Bob's your uncle.
